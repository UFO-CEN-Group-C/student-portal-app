## Workflow for CEN Group C

- For each user story, the team member working on the user story will create a feature branch with a name that describes what they are working on.
  - If a member of the team is working on a large user story, or multiple members of the team are working on the same user story, branches may be created for each task within the user story.
- All changes for a user story or task will be committed to the branch that was created for that user story or task.
- Before creating a pull request, each team member will ensure that their branch contains all of the latest commits from the **master** branch in GitHub.  
  - Ideally, this should be done prior to each push of the branch to GitHub.
- When a feature is complete, all code has been committed, and all commits have been pushed to GitHub, the team member who made the changes will create a pull request to merge the commits into the **master** branch.
- At least one other member of the team will review the changes in the pull request and merge it to the **master** branch if there are no problems with the changes.  If anything needs to be modified before merging, the pull request will be closed without merging.
